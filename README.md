# Scream Bird - Flappy birds, except I replaced the tapping functionality with voice activated.
# By Jason McCoy

**Summary:**

This application was created as a clone for the game, Flappy Bird, which I pulled from Deborah [GitHub Project I Forked](https://github.com/deborahelizabethpadilla/Flappy-Bird). To learn more about what Flappy Bird is, please visit its [website](https://flappybird.io). This project firmed up my knowledge on creating an application that implements SpriteKit.


**The application offers the following features:**

**Technologies Used In Application:**
* SpriteKit
* SKActions
* SKSpriteNodes
* Swift
* Openear framework (I tested 5 frameworks and openear is the best framework of all of them.)


**Thought process on choosing the best framework:**
Google voice, Bing Voice was based on an online server, so they can't be faster than apple or openear.

**Here is the flow:**
Audio recognize -> listening voice -> check quiet (end speech) -> processing -> recognize -> check right text -> action.


**Testing The App:**
* Download the project to your computer from this project page.
* Once the project is downloaded, open the .xcodeproj file from the folder.
* Run the project either using the iPhone simulator or your device. I recommend running the project on the latest iPhone device. It should be compiled with the latest version of Xcode.
* If you choose to download it on your device, please plug in your device to your computer and make the device target your device model. Then click 'run'.


**Closing:**

In conclusion, I have learned a lot by working on this project. I am confident that I mastered SpriteKit in order to create an exciting and engaging application. Big thanks to [Deborah Elizabeth Padilla](https://github.com/deborahelizabethpadilla) for creating an iOS application that replicates the game, Flappy Bird for me to work on :).
